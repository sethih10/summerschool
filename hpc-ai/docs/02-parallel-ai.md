# Single GPU vs Multi-GPU training
- Training ML models could be intense
  - Heavy computations
  - Large Model
- That's why we might need use multiple GPUs to train
  - GPUs could be accross multiple nodes
- Multi-GPU or Multi-Node training has overhead
  - Communication costs
  - Distributation of the data
  - Underutilization

# DataLoader Issue

- Most common bottleneck in workflows  
- Causes the underutilization issue  
- Reserve enough CPU cores per GPU (7 cores/GPU on LUMI)  
- Use multiple workers (processes) in PyTorch `DataLoader`  

```python
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, ..., num_workers=N)
```

# DDP vs DP
- DP is Python threads-based, DDP is multiprocess-based 
  - No Python threads limitations, such as GIL
- Simpler data flow
- Both have high inter-GPU communication overhead (all-reduce)
  - DDP has a lower overhead, but still high
- Overlapping pipeline of gradient all-reduce with layer gradient computation
- DDP is generally the recommended approach

# How MP works?

# Mix and Match: DP + PP!
  ![](img/dp_pp.png){.center width=70%}
- This is from [Deepspeed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/zero-deepspeed-new-system-optimizations-enable-training-models-with-over-100-billion-parameters/)

- It reduces the bubble issue

- For DP, there are two GPUs: GPU0 and GPU1

- Inside each DP rank, there is a PP.

# Reality: 3D Parallelism

- In real world: Data Parallel + Tensor Parallel + Pipeline Parallel are combined.  
- Example: Training GPT-3 used all three.

# ZeRO: Advance Data Parallelism
- Issue with DP: Full optimizer states and gradients duplicated on every GPU.
  - Not efficient with VRAM
- ZeRO Idea: Partition optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across GPUs.
- Result: Efficient use of VRAM
  - Train MUCH larger models without running out of memory.


# ZeRO
<div class="column"  style="width:100%; text-align: center;">
  ![](img/parallelism_zero.png){width=100%}
</div>


# ZeRO Stages
- For 7B model with 64 GPUs:
- Zero-1O: ptimizer State Partitioning
  - 4x memory reduction, same communication volume as DP
- Zero-2: Optimizer + Gradient Partitioning
  - 8x memory reduction, same communication volume as DP
- Zero-3: Optimizer + Gradient + Parameter Partitioning
  - Memory reduction is linear with DP degree.
  - For example, with 64 GPUs will yield a 64x memory reduction.
  - There is a modest 50% increase in communication volume.

  
# Summary
- Model fits onto a single GPU -> DDP or ZeRO
- Model doesnâ€™t fit onto a single GPU
  - Fast intra-node/GPU connection -> PP, ZeRO, TP
  - Without intra-node/GPU connection -> PP
- Largest Layer not fitting into a single GPU -> TP
- Multi-Node / Multi-GPU:
  - ZeRO - as it requires close to no modifications to the model
  - PP+TP+DDP: less communications, but requires massive changes to the model
  - PP+TP+ZeRO-1: when you have slow inter-node connectivity and still low on GPU memory

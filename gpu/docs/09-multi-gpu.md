# Computing in Parallel

- parallel computing
    - a problem is split into smaller subtasks
    - multiple subtasks are processed simultaneously using multiple GPUs

# Three Levels of Parallelism

1. GPU - GPU threads on the CUs: HIP
2. Node - Multiple GPUs and CPUs: MPI, OpenMP
3. Supercomputer - Many nodes connected with interconnect: MPI

# GPU Context

* a context is established implicitly on the current device when the first HIP function requiring an active context is evaluated 
* several processes can create contexts for a single device
    * the device resources are allocated per context
* by default, one context per device per process in HIP
    * (CPU) threads of the same process share the primary context (for each device)
* HIP and SYCL support explicit context management, OpenMP does not

::: notes
A GPU context is an execution environment that manages resources such as memory allocations, streams, and kernel execution for a specific GPU. It acts as an interface between the application and the GPU, ensuring that operations like memory management and kernel launches are handled correctly.

# Querying Device Properties

* one can query the properties of different devices in the system
    * no context needed
    * provides e.g. name, amount of memory, warp size, support for unified
      virtual addressing, etc.
    * useful for code portability
  
```cpp
// HIP - get device properties as struct
hipDeviceProp prop;
hipGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device)

// OpenMP - use `requires` clause to verify the device properties, e.g.
#pragma omp requires unified_shared_memory

//SYCL
auto p_name = device.get_platform().get_info<info::platform::name>();
auto max_work_group = device.get_info<info::device::max_work_group_size>();
```

# Multi-GPU Programming Models

<div class="column">
* one GPU per process
    * syncing is handled through message passing (e.g. MPI)
* many GPUs per process
    * process manages all context switching and syncing explicitly
* one GPU per thread
    * syncing is handled through thread synchronization requirements

# One GPU per Process

* recommended for multi-process applications using MPI
* message passing library takes care of all GPU-GPU communication
* each process interacts with only one GPU which makes the implementation
  easier and less invasive (if MPI is used anyway)
    * apart from each process selecting a different device, the implementation
      looks much like a single-GPU program
    * easy manage device selection using environment variables `ROC_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`


# Many GPUs per Process

* process switches the active GPU using `hipSetDevice()` (HIP) or `omp_set_default_device()` (OpenMP)
* after selecting the default device, operations such as the following are effective only
  on the selected GPU:
    * memory operations
    * kernel execution
    * streams and events (HIP)
* asynchronous function calls (HIP)/`nowait` (OpenMP) for overlapping work
* in SYCL each device has a different queue and all calls are asynchronous

# Many GPUs per Process: Code Example 

 <div class="column" width=85%>
<small>

* HIP
```cpp
// Launch kernels (HIP)
for(unsigned n = 0; n < num_devices; n++) {
  hipSetDevice(n);
  kernel<<<blocks[n],threads[n], 0, stream[n]>>>(args[n], size[n]);
}
//Synchronize all kernels with host (HIP)
for(unsigned n = 0; n < num_devices; n++) {
  hipSetDevice(n);
  hipStreamSynchronize(stream[n]);
}
```
* OpenMP
```cpp
// Launch kernels (OpenMP)
for(int n = 0; n < num_devices; n++) {
  omp_set_default_device(n);
  #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for nowait
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < size[n]; i++)
    // Do something
}
#pragma omp taskwait //Synchronize all kernels with host (OpenMP)
```
</small>
</div>


 <div class="column" width=14%>
<small>

* SYCL 
```cpp
// Launch kernels (SYCL)
for(unsigned n = 0; n < num_devices; n++) {
  q[n].parallel_for(size[n], [=](id<1> i) { ...});
}
//Synchronize all kernels with host (SYCL)
for(unsigned n = 0; n < num_devices; n++) {
  q[n].wait();
}
```
</small>
</div>


# One GPU per (CPU) Thread

* one GPU per CPU thread
    * e.g. one OpenMP CPU thread per GPU being used
* HIP and SYCL APIs are threadsafe
    * multiple threads can call the functions at the same time
* each thread can create its own context on a different GPU
    * when setting the device a context per thread is created
    * easy device management with no changing of device
* from the point of view of a single thread, the implementation closer to a single-GPU case
* communication between threads still not trivial


# One GPU per (CPU) Thread: Code Example


<div class="column" width=85%>
<small>

* HIP 
```cpp
// Launch and synchronize kernels
// from parallel CPU threads using HIP
#pragma omp parallel num_threads(num_devices)
{
  unsigned n = omp_get_thread_num();
  hipSetDevice(n);
  kernel<<<blocks[n],threads[n], 0, stream[n]>>>(args[n], size[n]);
  hipStreamSynchronize(stream[n]);
}
```
* OpenMP 
```cpp
// Launch and synchronize kernels
// from parallel CPU threads using OpenMP
#pragma omp parallel num_threads(num_devices)
{
  unsigned n = omp_get_thread_num();
  #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for device(n)
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < size[n]; i++)
    // Do something
}
```
</small>
</div>

 
 <div class="column" width=14%>
<small>

* SYCL 
```cpp
//Launch and synchronize kernels
// from parallel CPU threads using SYCL
#pragma omp parallel num_threads(num_devices)
{
  unsigned n = omp_get_thread_num();
  q[n].parallel_for(size[n], [=](id<1> i) { ...});
  q[n].wait();
}
```
</small>
</div>

# Direct Peer to Peer Access

* access peer GPU memory directly from another GPU
    * pass a pointer to data on GPU 1 to a kernel running on GPU 0
    * transfer data between GPUs without going through host memory
    * lower latency, higher bandwidth

```cpp
// Check peer accessibility
hipError_t hipDeviceCanAccessPeer(int* canAccessPeer, int device, int peerDevice)

// Enable peer access
hipError_t hipDeviceEnablePeerAccess(int peerDevice, unsigned int flags)

// Disable peer access
hipError_t hipDeviceDisablePeerAccess(int peerDevice)
```
* between AMD GPUs, the peer access is always enabled (if supported)

# Peer to Peer Communication

* devices have separate memories
* memcopies between different devices can be done as follows:

```cpp
// HIP: First option that requires unified virtual addressing (use "hipMemcpyDefault" for "kind")
hipMemcpy(dst, src, size, hipMemcpyDefault);

// HIP: Second option does not require unified virtual addressing
hipMemcpyPeer(dst, dstDev, src, srcDev, size);

// OpenMP
omp_target_memcpy(dst, src, size, dstOffset, srcOffset, dstDev, srcDev);
```
* when p-t-p  is missing the copying is done through host memory 
* no equivalent `hipMemcpyPeer` in SYCL
     * implementation dependent behaviour


# GPU-GPU Communication through MPI

* CUDA/ROCm aware MPI libraries support direct GPU-GPU transfers
    * can take a pointer to device buffer (avoids host/device data copies)
* currently no GPU support for custom MPI datatypes (must use a
  datatype representing a contiguous block of memory)
    * data packing/unpacking must be implemented application-side on GPU
* on LUMI, enable on runtime by `export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1`
* having a fallback for pinned host staging pointers is a good idea.



# Device management

```cpp
// HIP
int count, device;
hipGetDeviceCount(&count);
hipSetDevice(device);
hipGetDevice(&device);
hipDeviceReset();

// OpenMP
int count = omp_get_num_devices();
omp_set_default_device(device);
int device=omp_get_default_device();

//SYCL
auto gpu_devices= sycl::device::get_devices(sycl::info::device_type::gpu);
auto count = size(gpu_devices);
queue q{gpu_devices[device]};
auto dev = q.get_device();
```

# Selecting the Correct GPU

* typically all processes on the node can access all GPUs of that node
* implementation for using 1 GPU per 1 MPI process

```cpp
int deviceCount, nodeRank;
MPI_Comm commNode;
MPI_Comm_split_type(MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED, 0, MPI_INFO_NULL, &commNode);
MPI_Comm_rank(commNode, &nodeRank);
hipGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
hipSetDevice(nodeRank % deviceCount);
```
::: notes
* Can be done from slurm using `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`

# Compiling MPI+GPU Code


* trying to compile code with any HIP calls with other than the `hipcc` compiler can result in errors
* either single source code (MPI + GPU), set MPI compiler to use `gpucc`:
 
    * OpenMPI: `OMPI_CXXFLAGS='' OMPI_CXX='hipcc'`
    * on LUMI: `'CC --cray-print-opts=cflags' <gpu_mpi_code>.cpp 'CC --cray-print-opts=libs'`
* or separate HIP and MPI code in different compilation units compiled with
  `mpicxx` and `gpucc`
    * Link object files in a separate step using `mpicxx` or `hipcc`
* **on LUMI, `cc` and `CC` wrappers know about both MPI and HIP/OpenMP**

# Summary

- there are various options to write a multi-GPU program
- in HIP/OpenMP a device is set, and the subsequent calls operate on that device
- in SYCL each device has a separate queue
- often best to use one GPU per process + MPI for communications
- use direct peer to peer transfers when available in multithreaded cases
- GPU-aware MPI is required when passing device pointers to MPI

     * Using host pointers does not require any GPU awareness

- on LUMI GPU binding is important

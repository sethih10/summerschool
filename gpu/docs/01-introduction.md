# Why?

But why?

Why move data back and forth from CPU to GPU to CPU?

What's the benefit?

::: notes
This begs the question(s):

What's the point of moving data to the GPU, doing the computation there, then moving it back, instead of just doing the computation locally by the CPU?

Do GPUs run faster that CPUs?

What's the benefit?
:::

# GPU as a wide SIMD unit

::: notes
The answer to the penultimate question is no: GPUs usually have 2-3 times lower clock speeds than CPUs: 1 GHz vs 2-4 GHz.

It makes sense to move data to the GPU and let it do the computation, because, although they run slower, GPUs are ￼￼massively￼￼ parallel. You could think of GPUs as very, very wide SIMD or vector units. Think thousands of lanes wide.

# SIMD

::: notes
SIMD stands for Single Instruction, Multiple Data. This is literal: the vector unit performs the same exact instruction (e.g. +) for multiple pieces of data at the same time, i.e. during the same cycle.

So instead of doing c = a + b for a single a and a single b, yielding a singular c, you do it for vectors of values a and b. Then you get a vector of values c. This means the￼throughput, i.e. "how many elements you process in a given amount of time", of a vector unit is large.

The concept of a vector unit is not novel, nor is it unique to the GPU. CPUs have vector units as well, but they are narrower than on a GPU.

# Which is faster, CPU or GPU?

::: notes
Let's gather our thoughts.

- Moving data from the CPU memory to the GPU memory takes time
- Doing the computation on the GPU takes time
- Finally, moving the data back from the GPU memory to the CPU memory takes time

This is all time that could be spent doing the computation on the CPU.

But we just discovered, that the GPUs are massive parallel units, and thus they can perform the same instruction to multiple pieces of data at the same time.

So which is faster:

1. Doing the computation on the CPU, or
2. Moving data back and forth and using the GPU to do the computation?

A simple answer is: it depends on how much data you have.
:::

It takes time to

- Move data to the GPU
- Compute on the GPU
- Move results to the CPU

So is it faster to use the CPU or the GPU?

# Runtimes of Taylor expansion, memory bound
::: notes
In this graph we have a plot of problem size (horizontal axis) vs runtime (vertical axis).

The legend tells us there are three different versions of the computation:

1. A completely serial computation
3. OpenMP with 64 threads
4. GPU

The serial part runs fastest, if we have less than $2000$ elements.

Then we see the OpenMP version with 64 threads dominate, if the number of elements is between $2000$ and $300 000$.

Finally, once the problem size is larger than $300 000$, the GPU version starts to dominate.

We can also see the GPU and OMP64 versions having a roughly constant runtime, when the number of elements is $< 300 000$, even if the problem size increases.

This indicates that the problem is too small to actually use all the available resources: scaling up the problem doesn't cost anything extra, because there are an abundance of free units for doing the work.

Another thing visible is the runtime penalty of using GPUs and multithreaded CPUs:
The runtime difference between the serial version and the other versions is the overhead of using the more parallel versions.

This means it's actually much faster to just do the computation locally, with a single thread, than it is to either spin up a bunch of threads and distribute the problem among them, or copy the data to the massively parallel GPU and let it solve the problem.

Now we are better equipped to understand why and when should we use a GPU and when to do the work locally.

There are many more things to consider, and one should always make informed decisions by measuring the actual performance of the application instead of relying on generic guidelines. But guidelines serve as a starting point.

::: notes
In this final plot we have three different amounts of computation for the three different implementations.

One interesting thing to note is that there's no qualitative difference between any of the GPU versions,
while there's some cache behaviour visible in the CPU versions.

This highlights the difference between the CPU and the GPU:
the GPU concentrates on hiding the memory access latency by having thousands of threads doing work at
the same time. That's why it's impossible to infer the size of GPU caches from high level plots like these,
while it's possible to make some educated guesses about the CPU cache sizes, due to the qualitative
difference in the plots.

# Recap

::: notes
Let's do a review:

GPU is a massively parallel processor with its own memory space.

You copy data from the CPU memory to the GPU memory and tell the GPU to do some computation on that data.

The GPU can execute instructions on thousands of pieces of data at the same time.

Using a GPU makes sense, if you have enough data to crunch. If not, it's better to do the computation locally with the CPU.

# GPU as a wide SIMD unit

::: notes
Earlier we learned GPUs could be thought of as very wide SIMD units.

This is, of course, quite silly.

Why?

Becaues a vector unit executes the same instruction to multiple pieces of data per cycle.

If we have thousands of lanes, every time we want to execute some instruction to say 32 or 128 or even 256 elements, we lose most of our performance.
Most of the hardware is doing nothing.

# GPU as a collection of independents vector units

::: notes
A better model of a GPU is a collection of multiple independent vector units.

On the left we have the GPU consisting of 32 independent vector units.
On the right we have a single vector unit, 16 lanes wide.

What does independent mean here?

It means each of these units can perform a single instruction to it's pieces of data, regardless of what, if anything, the other vector units are doing.

Usually the vector units themselves have something like 16 lanes.

This means this GPU could do (lanes/unit x num_units) = $16 \times 32 = 512$ instructions per cycle. And since the units are independent, not all 512 of those instructions have to be the same.

# Who controls the vector units?

::: notes
Who or what tells the different vector units what instruction to do and to which data? Am I, the programmer, responsible for that?

If you're familiar with vectorizing code on the CPU, a reasonable answer is
"Yes, I, the programmer, am responsible".

For GPUs, you could write the vector instructions by hand using a (hardware vendor specific) low level assembly-like language, but instead it's more common and more productive to write in a higher level language like Cuda/HIP/Sycl.

With these languages, the nature of the GPU as a collection of independent vector units is actually hidden from the programmer. The programming model is called SIMT, for Single Instruction, Multiple Threads.

So if the programmer isn't directly responsible for mapping data to vector registers and then calling vector instructions, how does it happen?

# GPU as a collection of processors

::: notes
Better model of a GPU is a collection of independent and very simple processors, which contain vector units.

AMD calls these processors Compute Units (CU), Nvidia calls them Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) and Intel has many names for them, one of which is Execution Unit (EU).

The "other hardware" block hides a lot of details. We don't need to understand those details to write correct GPU code, though it it useful to understand them to write performant GPU code.

Let's compare this simple model to an actual schematic of two GPUs:

MI250X from AMD, as found on LUMI and A100 from Nvidia, as found on Mahti.

Here we have the "shader core"s, which are the vector units talked about earlier. Notice there are four sets of 16 cores.

Additionally we have "other hardware" which we abstracted away previously. As mentioned, most of this stuff is unnecessary for writing correct GPU programs, but useful for writing performant programs.

The most important other things for a starting programmer are the Local Data Share (LDS) and L1 Cache. These are both related to the memory hierarchy of the GPU, which we'll learn about in later lectures.

::: notes
Similar to the CU of the MI250X, we have "four vector units". As seen on the diagram, this is a heavily simplified statement, but we can see there are four sub-partitions to the SM (SMSP, Streaming Multiprocessor Sub-Partition).

Each of these SMSPs have cores for handling INT32, FP32 and FP64 computation, as well as "other hardware", e.g. scheduler, registers and caches.

Again, the most important new thing here for a beginner programmer is the L1 Data Cache / Shared Memory at the bottom of the image. We'll learn about these later.

The GPU gets it computational power from tens or hundreds of simple processors called compute units, streaming multiprocessors or execution units, depending on the hardware vendor. These simple processors have multiple vector units inside them (in addition to other hardware) and they can execute a single instruction per cycle per vector unit. The entire GPU can execute $10^3 - 10^4$ instructions per cycle. CPUs can execute $10^1 - 10^2$ instructions per cycle.

# Programming GPUs

::: notes
Now that we've seen the hardware in (some of) its glory, let's finally discuss how one actually programs these things. As mentioned previously, the most common way of doing general purpose GPU computing is with a programming model called Single Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT), which was mentioned before.

With SIMT, the programmer writes GPU code from the point of view of a single thread, but within a larger context. Let's look at this through a more familiar lens of CPU code.
:::

::: incremental
- SIMT =  Single Instruction, Multiple Threads
- Write parallel code from the perspective of a single thread
:::

# Programming GPUs

::: notes
Here we have a simple double loop in C++ that sums up two arrays element-wise to a third one.

The larger context is "We have three 2D arrays, a, b, c, which are all $N \times M$ in size and we're executing some block of code $N \times M$ times"

The point of view of a single thread is "I'm going to take this single value from array a, sum it with this single value from array b and store it in this location in array c"
:::
::::::::: {.columns}

		for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
			c[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j];
		}
	}
}
```
::::::
:::::::::

# Programming GPUs

::: notes
So what does it mean to write code from the perspective of a single thread?

It means we partially "forget" the larger context, and let "someone else" handle it. Instead we focus on the block of code that is done "for all the elements", in this case $c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$

The GPU version would be something like this.

Here there's no double loop. "Someone else" takes care of it. We're just concerned about what happens to each element.

# Division of responsibilities

::: notes
So who is this "someone else" taking care of the larger context?

It's partly us, the programmer and partly the software stack (high level API, runtime library, device driver, etc.) and the hardware device that we're using.

Our responsibility is telling the device how many threads we want to run, and in what configuration.

Examples:
- 32768 threads in 1D
- 32 x 1024 threads in 2D
- 32 x 512 x 2 threads is 3D

After we've supplied this information to the device, it's its responsibility to launch enough threads and with correct thread indices and call the code we've supplied for each of those threads.

# Blocks – SM/CU

::: notes
Side note: Many blocks (from a single or multiple grids) may map to the same CU/SM.

However, the reverse is not possible. One block always maps to a single CU/SM, never to multiple.

# Warps, wavefronts

::: notes
At the SM/CU, the blocks of threads are further broken down to warps of 32 threads (Nvidia), or wavefronts of 64 threads (AMD)

Each warp/wavefront consists of consecutive 32/64 threads.

# Warp/Wavefront - SMSP/SIMD

::: notes
Then, the SM/CU maps each of these warps/wavefronts to a particular SMSP/SIMD unit

# Thread - lane

::: notes
Finally, each thread of a warp/wavefront is mapped to a single lane of a SIMD unit or to a single core of the SMSP.

# Recap

::: notes
Let's do a review.

The GPU is a massively parallel processor with its own memory space. The processing power of the GPU comes from tens or hundreds of simple processors (CU/SM) working independently and concurrently. These simple processors contain multiple vector units, which perform a single instruction for multiple pieces of data per cycle.

- massively parallel processor
- own memory space --> requires data movement
- useful when you have a lot of data
- consists of tens or hundreds of simple processors, with multiple vector units per processor
- 1-2 orders of magnitude more instruction per cycle compared to CPUs

# Recap

::: notes
Let's do a review.

To do some work on the GPU, we write some code from the perspective of a single thread and define a grid of threads using two levels of hierarchy defined by the API: a grid of blocks and a block of threads. We then ask the GPU to run our code for each thread in the grid.

The device maps the grid of threads to its hardware components: all the threads run on the same GPU. The blocks of the grid are mapped to the CUs/SMs. These then break down the blocks to warps or wavefronts of 32/64 consecutive threads and map each warp/wavefront to a SIMD unit or SMSP.
Each SIMD unit/SMSP executes a single instruction per cycle, doing this for all the lanes in the unit.

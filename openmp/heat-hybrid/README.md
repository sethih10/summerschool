## Heat equation solver with hybrid MPI + OpenMP

In this exercise, your task is to parallelize the two dimensional heat equation with hybrid MPI + OpenMP parallelization.
Starting point is a working MPI code parallelized over columns (in Fortran) or rows (in C/C++).
See previous sections for a general description of the heat equation solver.

### Fine-grained OpenMP parallelization

Here, parallel regions are only within the computational routines and all the MPI communication 
is handled by the master process. Your tasks are thus:

1. Initialize MPI with appropriate thread safety level
2. Determine the number of threads in the main routine ([cpp/main.cpp](cpp/main.cpp) or [fortran/main.F90](fortran/main.F90))
3. Parallelize the generation of initial temperature in the routine  `generate_field()` (in [fortran/setup.F90](fortran/setup.F90)) or in the `generate()` method (in [cpp/heat.cpp](cpp/heat.cpp)
4. Parallelize the main computational routine
   `evolve()` in [cpp/core.cpp](cpp/core.cpp) or [fortran/core.F90](fortran/core.F90)

### Coarse-grained OpenMP parallelization

Now, there is only one parallel region (within the main routine), however, MPI communication 
in the halo exchange is still done only by one thread (but not necessarily master).

1. Initialize MPI with appropriate thread safety level
2. Insert apprioriate OpenMP directives thoughtout the code

## Heat equation solver in parallel with OpenMP

Parallelise our implementation of a two-dimensional heat equation solver using OpenMP.
See previous sections for a general description of the heat equation solver.

Starting point is a working serial code, which you should parallelize
by inserting appropriate OpenMP directives and routines. For
coarse-grain parallelization here, **the whole program should have only
a single parallel region within the main routine**.

  1. Determine the number of threads in the main routine ([cpp/main.cpp](cpp/main.cpp) or [fortran/main.F90](fortran/main.F90))
  2. Parallelize the generation of initial temperature in the routine  `generate_field()` (in [fortran/setup.F90](fortran/setup.F90)) or in the `generate()` method (in [cpp/heat.cpp](cpp/heat.cpp)
  3. Parallelize the main computational routine
     `evolve()` in [cpp/core.cpp](cpp/core.cpp) or [fortran/core.F90](fortran/core.F90).

Note that execution controls might be needed in the main routine and in initialization.

To build the code, please use the provided `Makefile` (by typing `make`)

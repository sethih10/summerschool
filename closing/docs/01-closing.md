# Learning objectives

- The goal is to build HPC expertise up to an intermediate/semi-advanced level during the school.
- After the summer school, the participants will be able to:
  - Identify main parallel programming concepts
  - Create parallel MPI programs with C, C++, or Fortran programming languages
  - Create GPU-accelerated programs using HIP/CUDA
  - Recognize advanced parallel programming constructs
  - Understand and modify HPC applications utilizing MPI, OpenMP, and/or HIP/CUDA


# Summer School LUMI project

- Summer School LUMI project will end next week Thursday 10.7.2025
  - Please transfer out the data you wish to keep
